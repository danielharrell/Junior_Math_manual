## Edits
### For 2022 manual
- A number of errors corrected from the list in Greg Recco's 2021 archon report.
- A figure from the "New Method" paper has replaced a figure from the "Hanging Chain" paper on the cover of the manual.
- Spaces on either side of em-dashes ("---") have been deleted.
- Created more space between equation and footnote line, page 22.
- Added `Alternate_text` and `figs_unused` folders. Put relevant files in those folders.
- Replaced hand-drawn figure for first finding-tangent example (fig. 28) with a TikZ picture.
## To Do
- See if notes can be separated from text to produce separate manuals for readings and commentary.
- Replace handdrawn figures for $v=x^2+2$ (figs 20 and 24) with TikZ pictures.
- Find other formatting issues to improve.
